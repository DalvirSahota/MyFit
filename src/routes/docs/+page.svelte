	<blockquote>Just a basic overview of things work in this app, as there are some differences from V2</blockquote>

	<h2>Exercise splits</h2>
	<p>
		An exercise split refers to how workout sessions are divided across different days to target specific muscle groups
		or movement patterns. Examples: <i>Push Pull Legs</i>, <i>Upper Lower</i>, and <i>Full Body.</i>
	</p>
	<p>Tha app supports both synchronous (weekly) splits, and asynchronous splits (non-weekly) splits.</p>

	<h2>Mesocycle</h2>
	<p>
		A mesocycle is a unit of training consisting of several microcycles (repeated splits), usually lasting 4-6 weeks.
		The mesocycle structures progression and recovery, with increasing intensity or volume followed by deload phases to
		avoid overtraining.
	</p>

	<h2>Workouts</h2>
	<p>
		A single workout, consisting of multiple exercises, each with their own sets and options. Workouts can be done with
		or without an active mesocycle. Using an active mesocycle allows the app to progress performance and sets every
		microcycle.
