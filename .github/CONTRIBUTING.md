## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (v20.16.0 or higher)
- **npm**
- **TypeScript**
- **Docker** (if applicable, for local CockroachDB setup)

### Setup Instructions

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository:

   git clone https://github.com/WhyAsh5114/MyFit.git
   cd MyFit
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up your environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the necessary values.

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Code Structure

- **Frontend**: The app is built with SvelteKit
- **Backend**: API calls are handled using tRPC
- **Database**: Prisma with CockroachDB as the provider
- **Testing**: Playwright is used for end-to-end testing

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114/MyFit/issues) first. If your issue is not listed, create a new one and provide as much detail as possible.

### Proposing Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes, and ensure the code is properly formatted and linted
3. Write tests if necessary
4. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your-feature-name"
   ```
5. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. Open a pull request (PR) to the main repository. Make sure to describe your changes clearly in the PR description

### Code Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Let TypeScript infer return types wherever possible
- **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass before opening a PR
- **Documentation**: Update documentation when changes affect significant functionality

### Testing

Run the tests to ensure your changes don't break anything:

```bash
npm run test
```

We use Playwright for end-to-end testing, so make sure to write tests covering new features or bug fixes.

## Code Reviews

All PRs will be reviewed by project maintainers. We may request changes or provide feedback to ensure the code aligns with the project's standards.
